<h1>Sunbit Instructions</h1>
<p>
    Every word is a name of a person from the Sunbit technology org family.
    Since worle words are always exactly 5 letters long, the logic goes like this:

<ul>
    <li>If the name is exactly 5 letters long, you can guess the name directly. This is true for first, middle and last
        names.</li>
    <li>If the first name is shorter than 5 letters, you can add letters from the last name to make it 5 letters long.
    </li>
    <li>If the name is longer than 5 letters, the first 5 letters are the word for our game.</li>
</ul>

for example:

<ul>
    <li>Doron Sinai -> SINAI, or DORON</li>
    <li>Marcelo Weissman -> WEISS, or MARCEL</li>
    <li>Yael Karmon -> YAELK, or KARMON</li>
</ul>
